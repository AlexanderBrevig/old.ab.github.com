At Wice we're making an IoT platform for businesses and consumers. We want to have a platform that is extensible and thus easily adaptable to the needs of our customer.

After a couble of weeks of prototyping, the schematic and PCB were designed by myself.

We ordered 20 prototypes from Seeedstudio, and they arrived looking like this:

I'm very pleased! I'll post back when I get them built.
