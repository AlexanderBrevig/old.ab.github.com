## What is Coderwall?
Coderwall is a community/social network site where people can share useful insight by means of a _protip_.
A protip is a small piece of information that would 've saved you time if you could have read it first.

## The Project
So, like any developer would, I wanted to author an API for the Coderwall profile.
I also expanded the API with a screenscraped collection of the users' protips.

The source is available here: <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderBrevig/Coderwall">Coderwall on GitHub</a>
You can also install it using the PAckage Maanger Console like so:

    PM> Install-Package Coderwall.Models
