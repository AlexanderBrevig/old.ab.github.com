<h1>Thai Chicken Curry and Coconut Milk</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dishes/thai.jpg" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>Recipe for two:</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>2-300g chicken
4tbs green curry paste
2ts peanut butter
400g coconut milk
1dl chicken or beef stock</p>

<p>1/2 onion
1 chili
1/2 garlic cloves
Ginger to taste (I like about as much as my thumb, silly rule I know)</p>

<p>2 carrots
1 spring onion
1/3 squash
1/2 broccoli</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>Start the process of making rice, do it as you like
Cover a casserole with oil on the bottom and heat it up
Add the curry paste, and after about 30 seconds (when things start to cool down a bit) add about 1dl of the coconut milk
(If you want a crispy chicken, fry it now - else add it to the casserole now)
As soon as the mix boil it is time to add the onion, chili, garlic, ginger and peanut butter.
From here, you'll need to add the stock and the rest of the coconut milk gently. Try to keep it boiling, at least steaming hot during the entire process.</p>

<p>Towards the end (when around 4 minutes are remaining for the rice to be done) add the carrots. Then wait how long you please before you add the sprint onion, squash and broccoli. I want them <em>al dente</em> as the Italians call it. Slightly firm and crisp.</p>

<p>Of course, feel free to add spices, salt and pepper to taste. I like to nuances of flavors that are present in this dish naturally, but you might want something more piquant.</p>

<p>Bon App√©tit</p>
