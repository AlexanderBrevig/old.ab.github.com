<h1>Bootleg?</h1>

<p>A bootleg recording is a recording made and released anyone other than the artist or the entity with legal rights of the material.
Why do I like that you might ask in these SOPA PIPA ACTA days?</p>

<p>Simply because my band is still in the very early stages and we have to appreciate any and all sign of appreciation by potential followers or fans (label them however you like).</p>

<p>That's actually a cover of Lady GaGa's <em>Judas</em> so I guess it's a bootleg (that is illegal and unauthorized copyright infringement) in two dimensions! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Uh3O_K8XXBY">Have a look</a>.</p>
