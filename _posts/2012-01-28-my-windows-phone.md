<h1>Windows Phone</h1>

<p>This is my <em>favorite</em> and most important tool while in transit.</p>

<p>It is simply a handset based on a windows operating system. As one should expect office (word, power point and excel) are available for viewing and editing documents. It is also easy to integrate with a Shared Point server, and One Note is natively supported by the phone with push notifications.
As a bonus you've also get access to some content on XBox Live!</p>

<p>Furthermore the WP represents a new path in the mobile industry with it's <em>Metro UI Design Language</em>. Everything is modeled after signs like you see in the metro.
Few colors, high contrast and overall a simplistic UX experience.</p>

<p>Personally I love the Metro look, and especially the concept of a tile instead of an icon.
Icons are boring and static and provide nothing more than anentry point into an application. A tile, or a <em>Live Tile</em> does that as well, but in addition it can provide useful information. The tile of the Mail app displays the number of unread mails in the inbox, and I can have a tile update with information about a friend in real time.</p>

<p>Tiles make me use the phone less, and thus they save me some time. Valuable time.</p>

<h2>My Questions</h2>

<p>I have a few complaints, and I hope there are solutions to them.</p>

<p>1 How can I simply search the contacts for a person to call?
2 Why does the sound of my HTC handset drastically change characteristics if I search while I listen to music?
3 Why does not the media/video player remember its state? If one watches a movie and the application is tombstoned I can never get back to where I was.</p>

<p>My HTC 7 is ready for retirement, and I'll get a Nokia Lumia 800. I'll post something when I make the change!</p>
