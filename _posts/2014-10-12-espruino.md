#Espruino is awesome!

Espruino is a JavaScript interpreter for microcontrollers.

You should check out the site <a href="http://www.espruino.com/">espruino.com</a> and the github here <a href="https://github.com/espruino/Espruino">espruino@github</a>.
The syntax should be very familiar if you know Arduino, because it uses the Wiring Framework function names.

Want to blink an LED?

    function toggle(){
      on = !on;
      digitalWrite(LED1, on);
    }
    var interval = setInterval(toggle, 500);
    
And that's it!


##REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)
The Espruino comes with a great Web IDE that ships with a REPL so you can interact with your product.
Want to interrogate the current value of a variable? Simply enter the name into the REPL, and it will echo the current value back.

This is such a productivity booster during prototyping, as you can basically try and fail without any compile or flash delays at all.
