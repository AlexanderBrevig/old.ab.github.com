#Programmer box for STM8/32, MSP430 and AVRs
I made a [thing](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:795738) on Thingiverse today :)

Here it is:
![programmer box](http://thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com/renders/2a/ed/81/04/db/wiredup_preview_featured.jpg)

As said in the Thingiverse description, it's a programmer box with

 * Olimex msp430-jtag-tiny-v2
 * ST-Link/V2
 * AVR ISP mk2

Everything I need at the moment :)

Which programmers do you use?
