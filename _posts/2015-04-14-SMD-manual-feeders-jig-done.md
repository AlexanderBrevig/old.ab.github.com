#Manual SMD feeders jig done!

Yesterday I started making my own jig for manual SMD work.
You can see the initial steps here: http://alexanderbrevig.github.io/projects/2015/04/13/SMD-manual-feeders-jig/

It is finally complete, and since images is worh more than x words (where x is said to be 1000) here are some:

##Overview

This will be my workstation for the process.

Everything is labeled, and the parts is so firm in place I can move it without much trouble (except the CC430 which came in a tube).

##Labels and feeders

I made a photoshop file with value and identifiers. Should be handy.

##Feeders

4 hour print on the Ultimaker 2 with PLA. Details in previous post.


#Next up, assembly!

This will be my first experience with assembly of SMT but I thing I've at least eased the job somewhat with this rig.
