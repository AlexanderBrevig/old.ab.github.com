<h1>The Binary Clock</h1>

<p>Read more about the binary in the wiki article for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system">binary numeral system</a>.</p>

<p>I have made a binary clock before using c++ and the <a href="http://wiring.org.co/">Wiring</a> platform.</p>

<p>So, now I just wanted to make something in javascript for the browser. Mainly for fun as a relaxation problem.</p>

<p>For a real project the css would be better placed in a .css file, but I was to lazy to upload multiple files for this post, so I made it as a single file.</p>
