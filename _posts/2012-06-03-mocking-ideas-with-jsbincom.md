<p>More often than not I find myself in the need of quickly get some HTML mock up and running that I can show to a friend or colleague.</p>

<p>After I discovered JSBin I have used it alsmost any time I could. It is brilliant to get you started writing UI and UX code for your next project.</p>

<h2>Two examples</h2>

<p>So I had an idea for my girlfriend that wanted a simple tool for mapping out her daily schedule. Here are two variations of how such an application could look:</p>

<h3>Variable Daily Length</h3>

<p><a href="http://jsbin.com/ucipan/7">timeschedule v0.7</a></p>

<h3>Fixed Daily Length With Time Column</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screencaps/ojuzen_2.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p><a href="http://jsbin.com/ojuzen/2">timeschedule rowbased v0.2</a></p>

<p>Both of those mocks were created in under half an hour, now that's what I call a flying start!</p>
