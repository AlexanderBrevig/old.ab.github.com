#AoE has finally arrived!

Behold the beauty:
<p><img src="/assets/images/artofelectronics.jpg" alt="The Art of Electronics 3rd ed." /></p>

If you live in norway I highly recommend <a href="https://www.adlibris.com/no/bok/the-art-of-electronics-9780521809269">adlibris</a>. I got mine within 5 days of ordering!

I really look forward to reading this book! It should serve well as a means to self educate on the wonderful subject that is electronics. I may write up a short review in time to come (this will be biased by the fact that I have no education and really I am in no position to comment on it other than my experience reading it).

Do you own a copy of AoE?
