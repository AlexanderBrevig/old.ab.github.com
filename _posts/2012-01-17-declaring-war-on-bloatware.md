<h1>Declaring War On Bloatware</h1>

<p>My computer came loaded with 'tools' and 'utilities' from the manufacturer of the computer. I noticed that these additions made my computer slightly slower, but as time has passed they have started to really annoy me.</p>

<p>I pledge to myself that the next time I get my hands on a new computer, the first order of business is to format and reinstall the operating system of choice. (Which will probably be Windows 8, I'm sure I'll write about that in due time.)</p>

<p>...Off I go then</p>
