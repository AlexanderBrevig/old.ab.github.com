#Manual SMD feeders jig
I am in the process of making 20 boards for work. I though I'd ease the process by making a feeder for my SMD parts (there's 35 or so).
Wihout much further ado, here it is:

I printed it with our [Ultimaker 2](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-2-family?gclid=CKbnmd7L9cQCFYzMtAodjUAAKw) and it took about 4 hours to print.

This print used PLA at 250&#8451; nozzle, 60&#8451; plate and 20% fan speed.

I'll post a complete overview when it's done!
